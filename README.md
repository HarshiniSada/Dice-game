How to Play:

Each player takes turns rolling a virtual dice by clicking the "Refresh" button.
After each roll, you have the option to hold your current score, adding it to your total score.
But be careful! If you roll a 1, you lose all the points from your current turn.
The first player to reach a pre-set score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
